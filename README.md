# GigHub

A music-centric platform for artists, fans, and music enthusiasts who want to connect, discover, and share all things music. 

## Description

If you've ever wanted to 
* Build a community around the music and bands you love
* Interact with your favorite artists on a more personal level 
* To share your love of an artist amongst other fans
* Leave the vapidness of regular social media behind and have an authentic, immersive music experience

Well, that's what GigHub is meant to do. A music platform born out of a shared passion for discovering and enjoying music, developed by music lovers for music lovers. It's designed to foster genuine connections through the shared joy of discovering and appreciating music. Straying from conventional social metrics, it prioritizes the essence of music, providing a space where true connections unfold with just one listen.


## Features
* As a band, create a profile 
* As a fan, be able to interact with your favorite artist and other fans
* As a fan, discover other artists based on the city and genre selected

## Challenges
The most significant challenge we faced during our platform development was figuring out how to take on a massive undertaking. It felt overwhelming. We had to scale down the platform since we weren't able to complete everything we wanted to in the timeframe we had. It will continue to be a work in progress. We still have a lot to do.  

## Installation
